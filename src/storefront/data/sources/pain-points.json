    "faq": [
        {
            "question": "Why does my faja burn my skin?",
            "answer": "Friction burns occur when fabric moves against skin or lacks breathability. Look for fajas lined with Viveltex (Vitamin E & Algae) to soothe skin and reduce friction. Cheap materials trap heat; our Cool-Touch nylon prevents this."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do I stop my faja from rolling down?",
            "answer": "Rolling happens when the garment structure is too weak for your movement. You need 'Spiral Steel Bones'—flexible supports that keep the faja upright. Also, ensure you have a silicone lace edge that grips the skin."
        },
        {
            "question": "Will a high compression faja flatten my BBL?",
            "answer": "Yes, if it's the wrong kind. Standard fajas compress everywhere. BBL-safe fajas must have a 'Zero Compression' zone made of thin mesh over the buttock area to protect the fat graft."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do I hide my FUPA?",
            "answer": "You need localized lower-abdominal compression. Our Tri-Layer Panel targets the lower belly specifically without compressing the hips, flattening the 'pooch' while lifting the rest."
